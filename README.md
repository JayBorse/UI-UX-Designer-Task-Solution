# UI-UX-Designer-Task-Solution
This repository contains my submission for the UI/UX Designer Coding Challenge. The task was to design a mobile app interface for controlling home appliances such as Fans, Air Conditioners, TVs, Lights, and Bulbs. Users can perform actions like turning appliances ON/OFF, adjusting fan speed, controlling AC temperature, modifying light brightness, and changing light colorsâ€”all from a single listing screen.

The designs were created in Figma, with a focus on clean and user-friendly UI/UX. Multiple screen design options are included to showcase different approaches.
